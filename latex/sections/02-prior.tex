\section{Prior Work}

Yao's millionaire problem appeared in \cite{yao1982protocols} in which he gives a solution to the two-party computation problem in the form of garbled circuits. Generalizations to multi-party computation was achieved independently by Chaum, Cr\{e}peau, Damg\aa rd \cite{CCD88} and Goldreich, Micali, Wigderson \cite{GMW87}. Of the advances in multi-party computation which occurred thereafter, we use Jakobsson and Juel's \emph{mix-and-match} scheme \cite{JJ00}.
